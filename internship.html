                            <p>
                                With my brief intership at WSAP, I learned a lot of things that helped me during my internship. At my first week in the internship, I was generally confused as I do not know how the system inside the company works. However, due to anxiety of not doing anything, I asked the Mobile Development Head if there is any tasks that are available and is up for the taking. Little did I know, that simple request I made was applaud by my superior. That makes the first thing I learned in a work environment, do not wait around for others to give you work, have the initiative to do something so that the adjustment to the new environment will be much smoother. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My superior given me a task to develop some of the features that will be added to the current WSAP mobile application. I was grouped with some of the newly added interns and took up the role as the leader of our team. I handled the creation of git repository, forking of the git repository of the WSAP mobile application, and provision of a dummy firebase database for handling CRUD for the features so that we will not affect the database that is officially used by the company. Our team were one of the fastest and efficient team because we were able to deliver our task - developing of the Todo, Note, and Wedding Tips feature way before our offboarding schedule. Our team were also the ones who handled the developing of the WSAP Mobile App Beta Launching Website for testing out the mobile application. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With having self-introspection, I have come up with the conclusion that my leadership has been quite poor. The crux of being a leader is being able to communicate with your members and able to report  updates and progress to respected superiors, but I perfomed poorly on the latter. I was not able to regularly report to my superior due to my own belief that I need only to report when there are results, but I was glad that I found out that such belief is flawed. Reports should be done regularly so that the company will be able to ensure that, us, interns are doing the tasks that were entrusted to us. Fortunately, my team members were capable enough to mitigate the effects of my poor leadership.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In conclusion, the internship at WSAP has been a fruitful experience, I learned a lot of technical and communication skills. I gained a lot of insight about what to do and expect at a  working environment of my career. These knowledge will be useful in bolstering up my foundation once I really step up to the real stage.

                                    <strong>Breaking down barriers</strong> - When I say breaking down barriers, I meant the breaking down of barriers we created within ourselves. Before having my internship at WSAP, I was contented with being confined to my self created comfortable barrier. However, when I was at WSAP, we interns were subjected to a sort of darwinistic system where only those who adapts survives. This might be a brutal analogy, but believe me this is the best that I can think of. We interns must get out of our comfort zone and go outside to find means for our own survival. The experience may be very hard and stressfull, but overcoming such trials will yield the version of oneself.

                                    <!-- <strong>Result-Oriented</strong> - This is one of the policies that are highly preached by the founder in the company, but were poorly implemented by him as well. I love the concept of result oriented companies, no mandatory attendance of your employees to work on site or an hour or two length meeting that is consisted of narcissism, glorifying of exploitation of interns, and etc. You can do whatever you want, but must also be aware of your responsibilies to the company and able to produce results. In simple terms, "Work Hard, Play Hard". -->
                                    <strong>Home-based Work</strong> - I know that this is similar to the online classes implemented by PUP but it felt different when you are working. With the current technologies that are being used now by developers, working on a project is now easier than ever through cloud. Collaborations with teams can be done using github, tracking of progress can be done in slack or any other similar platforms. The work from home concept that was implemented by WSAP resonates better with me because I believe that I perform better when I am left alone, for instance, when I am in my house. There are much less distractions that can disrupt me from working and at the same time being comfortable with just being myself. But of course, I am still very much open to the concept of on-site workplace as it promotes physical interaction with co-workers. Just being result oriented is enough for me rather than unnecessary daily mandatory on-site attendance with tedious public transportation present in our country.

                                    The most memorable event during my internship period was when me and my partner volunteered to handle the development of the WSAP mobile app launching website. We started from scratch and even desinged the resources that will used on the website. We worked for almost 3 days and even took overtimes because this project is important for the beta testing of the WSAP mobile app. It was a very satisfying experience in the internship period. The website we created can be accessed in this <a href="https://wsap-it-mobiledevteam.github.io/" target="_blank">link</a>

                                <h4 class="text-center"><strong>Recommendation for the Improvement of the Internship Program</strong></h4>
                                <p>
                                   As for what I experienced, I recommend that the intership program should have a real employee that gives insights to the interns. The internship program at the WSAP were filled with interns, the interns themselves are the running the company, from supervisor to the employee. The lone real employee of the company was the founder itself. With all that said, the strategy of putting the intern to the real situation is beneficial at best as we tend to get out of our comfort zones and show the best versions of ourselves.

                                <p>
                                   For my advice for those will taking their internship at WSAP in the future, be ready and do not expect the things you do at school where the information is spoonfed to you. You should always make yourself useful and has the initiative on integrating yourself to the company. You should also be ready to change yourself because the internship at WSAP is truly a life changer, it is up to you if you will you this oppurtunity to be the better version of you or succumb to your inhibitions.

                                    The following attached google drive is consisting of the evidences that proves that I applied and undergo the internship program under the WSAP. As for the Certificate of Completion, I have failed to comply to that because the PUP has withdrawn our internship from WSAP due to issues. However, we were told the Daily Time Record (DTR) is sufficient enough as a proxy for the COC.
